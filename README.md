### Experimental multi-project setup for Magarena.

Please note, the JavaFX projects, ``magarena-fx`` and ``magarena-fxml`` require version 8 of Java.

#### Clone local copy
Clone repository to local folder named ``magarena-ws``...  
``git clone https://github.com/lodici/magarena-ws.git``  

#### Netbeans Configuration
First create a Project Group...   

1. File -> Project Groups.
2. Click _New Group_ to open group dialog.  
3. Enter ``magarena-ws`` for the _Name_ field.  
4. Enable _Folder of Projects_ and browse to the folder in which the clone was created.  
5. Click _Create group_ and select to open all projects.

Update each of the following projects to use the java 8 compiler -

1. File -> Project Properties
  1. Sources -> Source/Binary Format = 1.8.
